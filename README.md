# Technohacks-Edutech-Data-Analytics-Internship

Welcome to the Technohacks Edutech Data Analytics Internship repository! In this one-month internship, you will dive into the world of data analytics, where you'll have the opportunity to work on various projects ranging from data cleaning to data visualization. Let's explore what this internship has to offer.

## Tools

For the tasks in this internship, we primarily use **Python**, a versatile programming language known for its data analysis capabilities. Here's how Python is used in this internship:

- **Data Cleaning**: Python is used to clean and preprocess the data, which includes handling null values and outliers.
- **Summary Statistics**: Python is also utilized to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Cleaning
In this task, you will perform data cleaning, focusing on removing null values and outliers. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.

### Task 2: Summary Statistics
For this task, your goal is to calculate essential summary statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation. The primary libraries used in this task are:
- **Pandas**: Again, we rely on Pandas for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For mathematical operations.

## Key Insights

Throughout the internship, you'll encounter some key insights, including:
- **Dealing with Null Values**: You will learn how to handle 10% of null values in the dataset, which can be done by either removing columns or rows or replacing them with the median.
- **Handling Outliers**: As part of the process, you will address 15 outliers in the dataset, improving data quality.
